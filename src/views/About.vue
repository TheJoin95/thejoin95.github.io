            <p>
              I helped Aperion and Plansoft to delivery high quality products, software and
              services to their customers.
              Since June 2021, I'm working at <a href="https://www.growens.io/it/" target="_blank">Growens</a>
              My core knowledge has been instrumental in resolving complex architectural
              and software development challenges.<br/><br/>
              Working within the scopes of a lot of technical roles such as software engineer,
                course trainer, tech lead,
              solutions architect and head of R&D, I have developed a precise understanding of
                various technicalities which
              has helped me in maximizing value of my company and products
              in my current leadership roles.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              My colleagues know me as an excellent communicator.
              I like to use an interactive approach for understanding and solving problems
              of varied scopes.<br/><br/>
              Iâ€™m also enjoying sharing the knowledge with the community by writing
              articles and build / contribute to open source project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Always striving to improve, I love learning new things and face challenging problems.
              I love to follow a mentor and I like to be mentor for others too.
            </p><br/>
            <p>In my experience I have always found a friendly and homely
              environment, even in large companies.
              I like to always give a touch of style to work, especially with
              the people who are part of it.
            </p>
              <p>I'm always looking for the next challenge and I would like to
              be part of the solution process.
            </p>

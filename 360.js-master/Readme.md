# Run the demo

## Set-up

Either upload code and media files to a http server, or [see instructions to run locally](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally). Make sure the media files are in the same location as the code, because of browsers' "[same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy)" security restrictions.

## Find 360° media

### Photos

Photos can be found by searching Google images for "equirectangular". Make sure the ratio is 2:1 (360° horizontally, 180° vertically).

See [this spherical panorama by Jón Ragnarsson](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonragnarsson/2294472375/) as an example.

### Videos

Coming soon...

## Requirements

Recent browser with WebGL enabled. See [WebGLstats](http://www.webglstats.com/) for information on your machine's capacities.

# Code

## Acknowledgments

The photo viewer is based on the [Three.js panorama_equirectangular example](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_panorama_equirectangular.html). It was adapted for use with a video texture.

Thanks to Martin Görner and Mr.doob for their introduction to WebGL workshop at DotJS 2012. See http://animateyourhtml5.appspot.com for more information.

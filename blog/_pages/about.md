Hi, my name is Miki Lombardi but you can call me **TheJoin**.

I'm a web dev based in Florence and actually I'm working for Aperion.

I like to improve myself and study everyday a new thing. I <3 python and javascript, but I usually program in PHP ('cause C-Style is for boss).

Bike addicted, amatour photographer and backpacker.

You can follow me on this blog, where sometimes I post some crazy stuff (especially with my raspberry), on [github](https://github.com/TheJoin95), on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thejoin95) (with some mountain bike stuff and beautiful panorama) and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/7257464/thejoin)

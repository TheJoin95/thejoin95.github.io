Or Ambisonic audio track? I&#39;ll suggest you to take your headphone, 5min of your time, and search &quot;8d song&quot; on youtube. Enjoy.</p> <p>It&#39;s sound amazing.</p> <p>So... I wanted to figure out if it was possibile to recreate the 8D effects with any audio sources. The response: yes.</p> <p>For this little project I choose Python with the PyDub library. I made a simple script right here: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/TheJoin95/ambisonics-3d-audio\\\">https://github.com/TheJoin95/ambisonics-3d-audio</a> Check it out, clone it and try it.</p> <h2 id=\\\"how-it-works\\\">How it works?</h2> <p>An Ambisonic track is totally a different track from a mp3 file or a video. It need to be recored by a special microphone, with at least 4channels. To reproduce the Ambisonic track you need to have multiple speaker (like a 5.1 and more).</p> <p>My goal is to make every single audio track an ambisonic track or, at least, make a 360/3D effects audio. We can recreate the 3D effects by using some effects (pass filter low|high) and panning the audio from the left earphone to the right side and viceversa.</p> <p>Of course, you can try to mix the audio track by invert the phase and overlap the track. This can guarantee you a good quality result.</p> <p>I&#39;ll suggest you to try the script on github with your favorite track.</p> <h2 id=\\\"editing-the-script\\\">Editing the script</h2> <p>You can edit the init.py file with your mp3 file to convert, e.g.</p> <p>{% highlight python %} interval = 0.2 * 1000 # sec song = AudioSegment.from_mp3(&#39;mp3/castle-of-glass.mp3&#39;) {% endhighlight %}</p> <p>then you can run the init.py script. The result (a mp3 file) will be produced in a compiled folder.</p> <p>Enjoy your 8D track.</p> \";\n// Exports\nmodule.exports = code;"],"sourceRoot":""}
